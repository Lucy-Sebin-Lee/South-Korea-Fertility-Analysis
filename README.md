# The Factors and Impacts on South Korea‚Äôs Fertility Decline: An Analysis of Social, Economic, and Demographic Impacts

## üìä Overview  
This project investigates the multifaceted causes and consequences of South Korea‚Äôs declining fertility rate, with a focus on the interplay between social, economic, and demographic factors. As part of the **SAS Hackathon 2023**, this analysis uses data exploration, visualization, and modeling techniques to uncover trends and insights that may guide policy and public awareness.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Analyze historical fertility rate trends in South Korea.  
- Identify and quantify key influencing factors (e.g., housing costs, employment rates, education levels).  
- Understand the demographic and economic impacts of declining birth rates.  
- Provide data-driven visualizations and commentary to support findings.
